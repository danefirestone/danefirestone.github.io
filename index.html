            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My background in IT at Amazon has always challenged me and pushed me forward to continuously expand my
                skills and knowledge. Amazon has given me the opportunity to grow within the software development space.
                At WCCI, they push me to learn all aspects of full stack software development and, most importantly, how
                to solve problems. I love to take new problems on, and work through them with my teams. I'm always
                excited to see what's next.</p>

                more projects, both personal and through WCCI.</p>
